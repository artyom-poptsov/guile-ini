* Version 0.5.5 (2025-01-07)
** =ini->scm= and =scm->ini= now allow to set the comment prefix
The INI reading/writing procedures now allow to set the commentary prefix.  It
allows library to read and write such variations of INI data as Desktop Entry
format <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop-entry-spec/>
defined by Freedesktop.org.

The default delimiter is ";" so old applications that use Guile-INI can use
the new version without any changes.  On the other hand the applications that
use the new API cannot work with old versions.

The Texinfo documentation is updated accordingly.
